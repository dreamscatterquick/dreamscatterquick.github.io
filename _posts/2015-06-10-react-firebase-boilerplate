title: A case for firebase, back-endless boilerplate

There are many decisions to make these days if you want to start an app, depending on your business requirements, development time constraints and other factors.

As much as I love the idea of a decoupled front-end and back-end app. I don't particularly enjoy the thought of learning rails, maintaining two separate codebases, building an API, performing SQL migrations, etc etc.

By using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as a substitute for a back-end we have a more intuitive method of maintaining a database and a simple API.

Presently it can take days to setup an environment, Gulpfiles are becoming so ridiculous in complexity web developers now need to know the basics of computer science to be able to compile a basic website.

Download this [boilerplate](https://github.com/kang-chen/react-firebase-gulp) and get started in a couple of minutes.

*note there are many variations on the React/Firebase boilerplate. Not saying this is the be all end all of boilerplates, but it certainly helps with getting started.
