title: A modern boilerplate
---

There are many choices these days if you want to start an app, depending on your business requirements, development time constraints and other factors.

To get started, you'd have to know a small bit about software architecture.

As much as I love the idea of rails I don't enjoy the thought of maintaining two seperate apps and building an API, or performing SQL migrations.

It can honestly take days not hours to setup an environment. Which is where this boilerplate comes in handy.

So for any front end developer that would like to dip into react world.

I use a mix of ES6 and ES5 syntax in the code.

I've thrown in the swiss army knife of good quality components that you can use at your disposal.

As exciting as products like Grid are, I don't believe computer automated creation of dynamic websites is the future.

Sooner or later software will become part of the education cirriculum, kids may hate it but kids often dislike what is good for them.
