Without going into too much detail about the specifics of the technology stack.

there are two scenarios

1. you render the html file on server and send up to client
2. you send client the javascript and the JSON data and get the browser to render it.

at this point, it seems like rendering the file on the server and sending it up to the client is the most straight forward route to performance.

size of the html file you’re rendering - 8kb minified
size of the data set which needs to be read - 3kb GZIPPED
size of the javascript file that processes the data and turns it into html - 2KB

send up 3kb and 2kb and get client to process.

If you want to save on server wait time

now we get to more options:

1. your backend is running rails (data source is generated by rails, rails takes datasource and generates html through ERB files)
2. your backend is running node (data source is generated by node, which also generates your html)
3. your backend is ruining rails and also node(data source is generated by rails, html generated by node)

test case

300 active users want to render the html at the same time.

case 1 and case 2 steps:

1. db lookup and serializer to construct the JSON response.
2. render json repsonse
3. send it to client


case 3

1. db lookup and serializer to construct the JSON response.
2. send json repsonse and client side JS
