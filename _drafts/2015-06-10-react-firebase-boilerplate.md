title: A case for firebase, back-endless boilerplate

There are many choices these days if you want to start an app, depending on your business requirements, development time constraints and other factors.

As much as I love the idea of a decoupled front-end and back-end app. I don't particularly enjoy the thought of learning rails, maintaining two separate apps, building an API, performing SQL migrations, etc ec.

By using [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as a back-end we have a more intuitive method of maintaining a database and a simple API.

Presently it can take days to setup an environment, this can be very frustrating if you're not proficient at basic computer science. Gulpfiles are becoming ridiculous in complexity.

Download this [boilerplate](https://github.com/kang-chen/react-firebase-gulp) and get started in a couple of minutes.

*note there are many variations on the React/Firebase boilerplate. Not saying this is the be all end all of boilerplates, but it certainly helps with getting started.
